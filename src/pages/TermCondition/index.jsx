        <b>B. PROVISION OF THE APP</b>
      </p>

      <p className="text-justified">
        1. Section 12 of the Public Gambling Act, 1867 provides that games of
        mere skill are exempt from the application of the Act. The Supreme Court
        of India and various High Courts in India have opined that a game of
        mere skill is a game “in which, although the element of chance
        necessarily cannot be entirely eliminated, success depends principally
        upon the superior knowledge, training, attention, experience and
        adroitness of the player. A game of skill is one in which the element of
        skill predominates over the element of chance.” No penalty can be
        imposed upon a person for playing such games of skill.
      </p>

      <p className="text-justified">
        2. Users must note that ‘Ludo’ game available for challenge in our
        platform is ‘Games of Skill’, under Indian law, and that we does not
        support, endorse or offer to Users ‘games of chance’ for money. While
        ‘Games of Skill’ do not have a comprehensive definition, they are those
        games where the impact of a player’s effort and skill on the outcome of
        a game is higher than the impact of luck and chance.
      </p>

      <p className="text-justified">
        3. It may be noted that States are permitted, by the Indian
        Constitution, to enact laws regulating betting and gambling in their
        respective jurisdictions. In furtherance of these powers, various States
        have enacted anti- gambling legislations. Such legislations are largely
        in concert with the Public Gambling Act of 1867 (and include the
        exception of “games of skill”). Where a State legislation on gambling
        exists, it prevails over the Public Gambling Act of 1867. In this
        regard, the Assam Game and Betting Act, 1970 and Orissa (Prevention of)
        Gambling Act, 1955 and Telangana State Gaming (Amendment) Ordinance and
        High Court Judgment in Gujarat, 2017 prohibits games with money stakes
        and also does not create an exception for games of skill. Therefore,
        currently, residents of Assam, Odisha, Telangana and Gujarat are not
        permitted to play on our site.
      </p>

      <p className="text-justified">
        4. The games rules are clearly defined on this platform and Users are
        encouraged to read, understand and follow these rules to be successful
        in these games.
      </p>

      <p className="text-justified">
        5. The games on our platform are ‘Games of Skills’, such that the
        outcome / success in the games is directly dependent on the User’s
        effort, performance and skill. By choosing how to play, the actions of
        Users shall have direct impact on the game.
      </p>

      <p className="text-justified">
        6. Every game will have some elements of chance, but in the form of
        challenges / obstacles that a User would be able to overcome using
        his/her skills and knowledge of the game. Elements of luck are present
        in every game to add thrill and excitement, but no two attempts at a
        game are identical so Users must use their skills in order to be
        successful
      </p>

      <p className="text-justified">
        7. Since the games available on our platform can be won through Users’
        skills and such skills may be enhanced with practice and experience, the
        performance of a User may improve with time and practice.
